Key Features
Data-Driven Predictions: Uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Crop_recommendation.csv dataset.

Soil Quality Score: Provides a confidence score (from 1 to 100) for the prediction, indicating the quality of the soil for the recommended crop.

Scalable Backend: Built with Flask for serving the web interface and handling API requests.

Model Persistence: Uses the joblib library for efficient loading of the trained model and StandardScaler.

Clean Interface: User-friendly web interface (index.html) for easy data input and result visualization.
