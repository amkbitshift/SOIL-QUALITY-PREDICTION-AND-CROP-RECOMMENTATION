üåæ Soil Quality Prediction and Crop Recommendation System üß™
A data-driven web application that predicts the most suitable crop for a given set of soil and environmental conditions, providing farmers (or users) with an optimal recommendation and a soil quality confidence score.

This project demonstrates a complete Data Science lifecycle, from data preprocessing and model training to full-stack deployment (Flask and HTML/CSS).

üéØ Project Goal
To build a highly accurate machine learning model that takes seven key soil and environmental parameters as input and predicts the ideal crop to maximize yield and resource efficiency.

‚ú® Key Features
Data-Driven Predictions: Uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Crop_recommendation.csv dataset.

Soil Quality Score: Provides a confidence score (model probability) for the recommendation, indicating the suitability of the soil for the predicted crop.

Full-Stack Application: Built using a Flask backend for API handling and a modern, responsive HTML/Tailwind CSS frontend.

Deployment Ready: Configured with gunicorn and Procfile for easy continuous deployment on platforms like Render or Heroku.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Local Setup)
To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites
You need Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/amkbitshift/SOIL-QUALITY-PREDICTION-AND-CROP-RECOMMENTATION.git](https://github.com/amkbitshift/SOIL-QUALITY-PREDICTION-AND-CROP-RECOMMENTATION.git)
cd SOIL-QUALITY-PREDICTION-AND-CROP-RECOMMENTATION

3. Install Dependencies
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

# Create and activate environment (Example for Windows/PowerShell)
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Ensure Model Files are Present
This application requires the following two trained files, which must be in the main project directory:

crop_model.joblib

scaler.joblib

Note: These files are generated by running the Google Colab notebook (colab_model_training.ipynb) and are necessary for the application to start.

5. Run the Application
Start the Flask web server from your terminal:

python app.py

The application will start running at http://127.0.0.1:5000. Open this URL in your browser to interact with the predictor.

‚öôÔ∏è Data Pipeline and Model Details
Dataset
Source: Crop_recommendation.csv

Features (Inputs): Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall.

Target (Output): label (Crop name, e.g., 'rice', 'maize', 'coffee').

Data Preprocessing
The notebook systematically performs the following steps, which are crucial for model performance:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Checking data types, unique values, and statistical summaries.

Missing Value Treatment: Checked for and confirmed no missing values (using .dropna()).

Duplicate Removal: Verified and removed any duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.

Outlier Detection: Used statistical methods (e.g., box plots) to verify the data quality.

Feature Scaling / Normalization: Used StandardScaler to normalize input features, ensuring the model is not biased by large differences in feature magnitudes (e.g., Rainfall vs. pH).

Model Performance
Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier

Metrics: Achieved high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating strong generalization capability for crop prediction.
